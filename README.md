What Is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)?
An initial coin offering (ICO) is the cryptocurrency industry's equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO). 


A company seeking to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service can launch an ICO as a way to raise funds.

Interested investors can buy into an initial coin offering to receive a new cryptocurrency token issued by the company.


This token may have some utility related to the product or service that the company is offering, or it may just represent a stake in the company or project.


This ICO project is for the NFT project deployed earlier on.
